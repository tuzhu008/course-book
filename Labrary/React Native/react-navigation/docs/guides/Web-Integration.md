# Web Integration

React Navigation routers work on web and allow you to share navigation logic with native apps. The views currently bundled in `react-navigation` currently only work on React Native, but that may change with future-facing projects like [react-primitives](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/react-primitives).

## Example App

[This website](https://reactnavigation.org/) is [built with](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/blob/master/website/) React Navigation, specifically using `createNavigator` and `TabRouter`.

See the source code of the site here: [App.js](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/blob/master/website/src/App.js).

To see how the app gets rendered on the server, see [Server.js](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/blob/master/website/src/Server.js). On the browser, the App wakes up and gets rendered with [BrowserAppContainer.js](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/blob/master/website/src/BrowserAppContainer.js).


## More Coming Soon

Soon this guide will be replaced with a more thorough walkthrough of react-navigation usage on the web.
